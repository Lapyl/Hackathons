# SAVE FaceMask

Covid-19 pandemic has made facemasks a norm rather than an exception.

Many types of facemasks are currently available in the market.

Most of them are unnecessarily complicated, costly to buy, extremely suffocating, and uncomfortable to wear.

We offer here a design of a facemask that is Simple, Affordable, Ventilating, and Enjoyable.

Take a needle with a strong thread pierced through it.

Take a cotton cloth as thick as a shirt cloth.

Cut two strips of cloth of about 2 inches by 4 inches.

Put one strip on top of the other strip, so that there is an overlap of about 1 inch along height.

Connect one end of the thread to the top left corner of the outer strip.

Leave about 5 inch margin of the string.

Connect the other end of the string to the top left overlap of the strips.

Connect one end of the thread to the top right corner of the outer strip.

Leave about 5 inch margin of the string.

Connect the other end of the string to the top right overlap of the strips.

Our facemask is now ready.

Wear this mask so that the outer strip covers the nose and the inner strip covers the mouth.

Let the two side straps go around your ears so that the mask stays on your face.

The flip type design allows ventilation and reduces suffocation.
