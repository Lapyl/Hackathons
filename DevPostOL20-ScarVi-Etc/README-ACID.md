## ACID - Acoustic Covid-19 Infection Deactivator

- It is well known that insects create and are greatly affected by sounds.

- We believe that Covid-19 can be affected by sounds just as most insects are affected by sounds.

- We propose to do some research on effects of inaudible acoustic waves and solitons on Covid-19 virus.

- We will determine the types of inaudible acoustic waves and solitons that can kill or deactivate Covid-19 viruses.

- We will then make Acoustic Covid-19 Infection Deactivator consisting of two kits.

- ACID's artificial intelligence kit will identify Covid-19 infected person within a group of people.

- ACID's acoustic shower kit will spread acoustic waves or solitons that can kill or deactivate Covid-19 viruses.

- Acoustic Covid-19 Infection Deactivators may be installed in locations where many people gather or travel.

- We believe that ACID will greatly reduce the spread of Covid-19.
